			ROX-Trasher
			freedesktop-compliant trashcan
			by Gabriel Rojas & Fernando Garcia Bermudez


BRIEF
~~~~~

This is a modified "Trash" Rox-App originally written for Puppy Linux and adapted for non-distribution specific versions of Rox-Filer.
Thanks to Dan Van Wormer for create the best trash app for this AMAZING file explorer.


NEWS FOR THIS VERSION
---------------------

See "Changes".

LICENSE
-------

GPL Version 2 (See "COPYING").

REQUERIMENTS
------------

zenity >= 2.12.1 (or less?) ------> HELP! to replace it and eliminate dependencies.

INSTALLATION
------------

Simply extract "ROX-Trasher-xx.tar.bz2".

OPERATIONS
----------

When you first click on the trash icon it will create (if it does not already exist) the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ROX-Trasher  directory.

Clicking on the desktop icon will open up the  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ROX-Trasher directory. 

Once the Trash is open you can right click on a "Trashed" item and select "Restore". This will copy the original file or directory back to its original location. If another item with the same name is in that location it will prompt you before it over-writes it.

Dragging and dropping a file or directory into the Trash desktop icon will move that file or directory into $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ROX-Trasher

Files and directories will have a unique number appended to the end of their names. This prevents new trashed items with the same names form over writing the old files.

Right-clicking on a file or directory and selecting "Send To - Trash" will have the same effect as dragging and dropping the file on the desktop icon. 

To restore all items, right click on the desktop icon and select "Restore all". The trashcan will restore all items stored in the trash directory and shows a info dialog with the names of the restored items.

To empty the trash right click on the desktop icon and select "Empty Trashcan". Emptying the Trash will display all the files and directories in the trash and ask for confirmation.

You will get a prompt if you send a symbolic link to the Trash. This is just to let you know that you are not sending the original item to the Trash.


FUTURE
------

- The posibility to add in Rox-Filer to be oficial part of the program (Thomas Leonard & Team, READ THIS :P).
- If the up item is posible, a item menu in Rox-Filer: "Send to Trash".
